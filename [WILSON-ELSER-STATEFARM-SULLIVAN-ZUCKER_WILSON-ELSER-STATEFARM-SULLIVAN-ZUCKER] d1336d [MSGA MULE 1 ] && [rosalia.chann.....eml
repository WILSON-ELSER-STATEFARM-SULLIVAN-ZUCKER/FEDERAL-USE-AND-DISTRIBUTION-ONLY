HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME =3D $0.00=0D
	=0D
(e) Definitions -=0D
=0D
(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.=0D
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted ba=
sis of any property claimed on a=0D
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct amount.=0D
=0D
(2) Gross valuation misstatement.=0D
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of=
 any property claimed on a return of tax=0D
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.=0D
=0D
(3) Property.=0D
For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D refers =
to both tangible and intangible property.=0D
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and=
 inventory.=0D
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to =
compete, leaseholds, patents,=0D
contract rights, debts and choses in action.=0D
=0D
=0D
(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -=0D
=0D
(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or g=
ross.=0D
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation mi=
sstatement on a return is=0D
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property =
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,=0D
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of =
100.=0D
=0D
Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-prop=
erty basis,=0D
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B,=
 but not with respect to property A,=0D
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.=0D
=0D
(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar=
 limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),=0D
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable =
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement=0D
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to s=
ubstantial or gross valuation misstatements.=0D
=0D
Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return is=
 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for propert=
y D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.=0D
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a substa=
ntial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated in apply=
ing the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if the port=
ion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the v=
alue of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the underpayment =
that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D, exce=
eds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).=0D
=0D
(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.=0D
=0D
The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a co=
rrect value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or =
more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with =
respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 4=
0 percent.=0D
