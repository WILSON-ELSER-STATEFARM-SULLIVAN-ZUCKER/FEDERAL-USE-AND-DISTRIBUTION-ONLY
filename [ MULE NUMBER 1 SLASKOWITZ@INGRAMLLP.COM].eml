defined

(a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense that- (1) any 
property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered, 
counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and (2) the 
defendant knew that the property was of such character; -such element 
may be established by proof that the defendant, after or as a result of 
an official representation as to the nature of the property, believed 
the property to be embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered, 
counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated.

USC 18 §225. Continuing financial crimes enterprise

(a) Whoever- (1) organizes, manages, or supervises a continuing 
financial crimes enterprise; and (2) receives $5,000,000 or more in 
gross receipts from such enterprise during any 24-month period -shall be 
fined not more than $10,000,000 if an individual, or $20,000,000 if an 
organization, and imprisoned for a term of not less than 10 years and 
which may be life. (b) For purposes of subsection (a), the term 
"continuing financial crimes enterprise" means a series of violations 
under section 215, 656, 657, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1014, 1032, or 1344 of

USC 18 §1962. Prohibited activities

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income 
derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity 
or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has 
participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, 
United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part 
of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control 
of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce.

(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with 
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate 
or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly,

racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of 
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

§1963. Criminal penalties

(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the 
maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit 
to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law- (1) 
any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of 
section 1962; (2) any- (A) interest in; (B) security of; (C) claim 
against; or (D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a 
source of influence over; any enterprise which the person has 
established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the 
conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and (3) any property 
constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, 
directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt 
collection in violation of section 1962. The court, in imposing sentence 
on such person shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed 
pursuant to this section, that the person forfeit to the United States 
all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise 
authorized by this section, a defendant who derives profits or other 
proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross 
profits or other proceeds. (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture 
under this section includes- (1) real property, including things growing

      18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest

(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title. (b) 
Subsection (a) shall not apply- (1) if the officer or employee first 
advises the Government official responsible for appointment to his or 
her position of the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest 
and receives in advance a written determination made by such official 
that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect 
the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee; (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the 
Office of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all 
officers and employees covered by this section, and published in the 
Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the 
requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the 
Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies; (3) 
in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

      the executive branch of the United States Government, or of any
      independent agency of the United States, a Federal Reserve bank
      director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the
      District of Columbia, including a special Government employee,
      participates personally and substantially as a Government officer
      or employee, through decision, approval, disapproval,
      recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or
      otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request
      for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy,
      charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which,
      to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner,
      organization in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee,
      general partner or employee, or any person or organization with
      whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning
      prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject
      to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title. (b)
      Subsection (a) shall not apply- (1) if the officer or employee
      first advises the Government official responsible for appointment
      to his or her position of the nature and circumstances of the
      judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or
      other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge,
      accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full
      disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a
      written determination made by such official that the interest is
      not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity
      of the services which the Government may expect from such officer
      or employee; (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the
      Office of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all
      officers and employees covered by this section, and published in
      the Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted
      from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
      inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
      Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;
      (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
      advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
      Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
      appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
      employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
      report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in
      Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the
      individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of
      interest created by the financial interest involved...</p>
