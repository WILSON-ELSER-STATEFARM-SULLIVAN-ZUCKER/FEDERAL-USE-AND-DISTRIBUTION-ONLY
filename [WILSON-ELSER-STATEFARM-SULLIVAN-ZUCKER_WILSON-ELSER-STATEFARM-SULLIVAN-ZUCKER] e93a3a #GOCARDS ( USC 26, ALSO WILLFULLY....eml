rimarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government securitie=
s, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requir=

the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a =
proposed rule that has been published for comment, the Commission shall r=
espond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed r=
ule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commis=

sely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government secu=
rities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropr=

at a history of egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for f=
uture participation in the securities industry even if the disqualifying =
conduct is not related to the professional capacity in which the responde=
