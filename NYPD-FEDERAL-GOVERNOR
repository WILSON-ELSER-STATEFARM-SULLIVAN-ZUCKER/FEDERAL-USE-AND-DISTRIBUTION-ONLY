*THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL **LURKING **AROUND, LOOKING TO SEE WHAT AGENCIES I AM DEALING WITH.*

-- EVEN AFTER HAVING FOLDED CIK FILER 93715, LOST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNDER CIK FILER 1516523 ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR FREEDOM, DESPITE THE RISKS OF THE POLICY HOLDERS OF "STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY" SHOULD BE SPEAKING WITH THEIR POLICY HOLDERS INDIVIDUALLY TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED WOULD BE SHOULD ALL POLICY HOLDERS PASS AWAY SIMULTANEOUSLY - FOR THE UPPER BOUND OF RISK.

Confirm USC Title 18.4, 18.3. 18.3, and under USC 18.225 violated and obstructed a federal investigation of a different variety by the counselors and accessories of 153974_2020 who obtained a loan forn$6 million from STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY and while on 9/23/2020 obtained another 600 thousand due to their hardships avoided prosecution by keeping me pre-occupied and atill carrybthe interest and burdens transferred to State Farm in Loan 50074, accrued both unlawful and imaginary interest at both HSBC and JP Morgan Chase Bank which is used for overnight lending by and between all banks.

Are those rent receipts matching up with the gross income (that is unlawful) matching the income reported to the NY dept of Finance as well?

In that case also has represented their confessions UNDER USC 18.225 and USC 18.21 as well as other violations of Security Law, namely manipulation of ticker STFGX lost the bulk of its market capitalization on December 21,2021.

Was this also a communal decision to mark its NAV at $106? Why not $107? Or $101? There is no material change in holdings reported for CIK filer 93715 or 1516523 as thisbwas obstructed by several accessories, counselors, and directors of Sullivan Properties LP.

Continuing Financial Crimes, $20 million / corp, an $10 million per inividual if you needed cause for obstruction oter than the minimum prison sentences implied.

Enjoy that while you consider how quickly problems get resolved for the 55 in an overnight and with my intervention.

Keep my family our of your affairs, and dont threaten them like the voicemail attached here carries a life and potential death sentence. Not sure if state farm will cover that as a provision of their terms of WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS who are still at risk while you play marco polo with the real statutues and laws. Which have statute of limitations.
Voicemail threatening an imaginary case, property and deed, confirmation of participation attached.
CONFIRMED.

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB

 have NO certificate of occupancy TO LAWFULLY COLLECT AND DEPOSIT SECURITY OR RENT FOR THOSE RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES.
 - IN FACT, OWE ALL OF THOSE RESIDENTS A REFUND AS WELL.

Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter

Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual proceedings and during the COVID-19 pandemic decided to Violate my Privacy and my home, perverted and self-proclaimed landlords most likely have more items which need be reviewed in their thought process ( as in evaluated ) to avoid "spillage" with the brains of general population, as I belive they are substandard, no matter how much money they have — combined. /s/ Bo Dincer.

 *Checking this box authorizes the FDIC to respond to your inquiry, no check box on the lease for the unlawful legal RECEIPTS which also may or may have been used in furtherance of the SEC filer, item 10 in Madoff, and USC 18.21 Violated as misrepresented to the public and used in conjunction with USC 18.225.

- see also: USC 18.2, USC 18.3, USC 18.4, and USC 26.X
