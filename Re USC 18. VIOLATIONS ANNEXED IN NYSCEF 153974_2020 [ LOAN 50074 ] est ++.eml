with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony

defence to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances 
manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal 
intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A 
renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole 
or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until 
another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar 
objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the 
defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of 
the evidence. (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this 
section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime 
because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because 
he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from 
prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger. (B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property. (C) Applicable procedures.-The 
procedures and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders 
under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse 
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall 
apply to temporary restraining orders under this paragraph. (c) 
Affirmative Defense. -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture 
under subsection (b) that the property- (1) is for a purpose not 
prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and (2) is of a type 
and quantity that under the circumstances is consistent with that 
purpose. (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General 
shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of 
any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section. (e) 
Assistance. (f) Owner Liability. -The owner or possessor of any property

(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest- -Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title. (b) 
Subsection (a) shall not apply- (1) if the officer or employee first 
advises the Government official responsible for appointment to his or 
her position of the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest 
and receives in advance a written determination made by such official 
that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect 
the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee; (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the 
Office of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all 
officers and employees covered by this section, and published in the 
Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the 
requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the 
Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies; (3) 
in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or 
(4) if the financial interest that would be affected by the particular 
matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of the 
officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in 
birthrights- (A) in an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized 
group or community, including any Alaska Native village corporation as 
defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs 
and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their 
status as Indians, (B) in an Indian allotment the title to which is held 
in trust by the United States or which is inalienable by the allottee 
without the consent of the United States, or (C) in an Indian claims 
fund held in trust or administered by the United States, -if the 
particular matter does not involve the Indian allotment or claims fund 
or the Indian tribe, band, nation, organized group or community, or 
Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or parties. (c)(1) 
For the purpose of paragraph (1) of subsection (b), in the case of class 
A and B directors of Federal Reserve banks, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System shall be deemed to be the Government official 
responsible for appointment. (2) The potential availability of an 
exemption under any particular paragraph of subsection (b) does not 
preclude an exemption being granted pursuant to another paragraph of 
subsection (b). (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any determination 
granting an exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made 
available to the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to 
the procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act 
of 1978. In making such determination available, the agency may withhold 
from disclosure any information contained in the determination that 
would be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For 
purposes of determinations under subsection (b)(3), the information 
describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive than that 
required of the individual in his or her financial disclosure report 
under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. (2) The Office of Government 
Ethics, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall issue 
uniform regulations for the issuance of waivers and exemptions under 
subsection (b) which shall- (A) list and describe exemptions; and (B) 
provide guidance with respect to the types of interests that are not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services the Government may expect from the employee. /***** //§118.
