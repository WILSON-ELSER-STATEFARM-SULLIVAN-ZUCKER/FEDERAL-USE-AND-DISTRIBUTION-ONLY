    Hence. A MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. *** ADMITTED AS ACCEPTABLE IN PROCESS | PROCEDURE OF THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT.
       
    This also presents an issue of Privacy for their purported 6000 other leaseholders, their leases, riders, and material documents provided to State Farm as annexed in the attached series, upon knowledge contracted their HQ. Please, take your time to respond; as Plaintiff (in the prior) worked in hours and have not responded to me, or returned my security deposit for one year. 

    *** The Federal Trade Commission Act bans "unfair methods of competition" and "unfair or deceptive acts or practices." The Supreme Court has said that all violations of the Sherman Act also violate the FTC Act. Thus, although the FTC does not technically enforce the Sherman Act, it can bring cases under the FTC Act against the same kinds of activities that violate the Sherman Act. The FTC Act also reaches other practices that harm competition, but that may not fit neatly into categories of conduct formally prohibited by the Sherman Act. Only the FTC brings cases under the FTC *** 


    I filed a report with the SEC and attached the same here... 
    So unless you are granting ALL LANDLORDS the right to film their Tenants Naked, without consent, and intrude on the privacy and sanctity of their homes as well
    [ laptops included ]
      ///  ///  ///  ///
    The Zuckers have established and Monopolized a much deeper view of a person's home; without consideration of the State, or Legal Age for consent, demonstrate they do maintain a record of how many Men and Women are in their view, as entered by Plaintiff in their claims "..mostly women...". 
       
    Against my will, however, harassed me daily, reported on my life as though I was on a reality TV show, and filmed me naked... even while on my laptop. I annexed these material items and photographs for a Year... and all the Judge did was dispose of all claims filed by Plaintiff in the matter, and ignore the obvious matter (or substance) in question.
        
       
       
    - Without a restraint order for Plaintiff [THE ZUCKER FAMILY], fine, or restitution paid to myself as requested in a MANDATORY recorded  Oral Argument 
      - Held by the Honorable Haggler, counsel for Plaintiff, and his clerk in Part 17. NY Supreme Civil.

    So in this respect and in YOUR duties. Please Advise.
        
       ITEM A.    61710 [ 8 - 9 - 10 ]
       ITEM B.    153974_2020_Sullivan_Properties_L_P_v_Baris_Dincer_EXHIBIT_S__379
       ITEM C.    DOC 152 - invoice
       
         There was no option or ['BOX'] to "select" counsel, thus impossible to legally hold me accountable for their legal fees.
         -- nor would I ever, as exhibited in their collusion [ 111 Docket 2.3.1 ] as Exhibited in their constant surveillance of my personal affairs.
