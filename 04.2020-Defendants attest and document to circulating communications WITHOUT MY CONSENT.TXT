xi. ITEM 24
11 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to several emails circulated internally by Defendants which in this case the Defendant was in the State of California, Notarized the same and entered separately in the ANNEXED email in EX04 – entered an additional Docket Number 14 under the false light of Alexis Brandon under the auspice of the ZUCKERS distributed, tampered, adjusted, and have not returned any photographs or videos as requested in email, letter, and by telephone – notwithstanding myself positioned and “…banging on the radiator…” on the 27TH of April, 2020 – which I affirm as ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G.

13 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by and between the principles of the ZUCKER, namely Laurie Zucker, Anne Brandon, Paul Regan, Cory Weiss, and other members named above re-iterate that ALEXIS BRANDON is leaving the building, after demonstrating that she was already in California on the 11TH while ANNE BRANDON was purported to be writing emails to the named defendants in the matter who in fact harassed me at all times demonstrably as referenced in ITEM 4 as a tenant in one of their properties and throughout the term and lease agreement which terminated on the 31ST of December, 2020 whereby my STUDIO was understood to be their “Premises” under which I was photographed, documented in the AFFIDAVITS of their residents, and purported as legal residents of the building and address where I resided in the County of New York, addressed formerly at 111 Sullivan Street, APT 2BR, New York, NY 10012.

LASKOWITZ, who on behalf of the YUZERS represented the interests of the ZUCKERS documented myself as locked out and capable of entering the premises as a basis of fitness. It was deemed of no consequence or urgency, as the Defendants in this matter were also neglectful of my physical health as furthered hereunder, despite the continuance as “chronicled” in the daily recount of my personal life. As referenced previously and during the time period referenced under ITEM 4 – obsessively would document each and every aspect of my life, certain of those claims are in fact a perjury under Federal and State Law, as sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized by the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.*
(15) <**voicemail attached>*
(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
(c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020
§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
(a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
-Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
(1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used by a person involved in the offense;
(2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation; and
(3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.
The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Procedures.-
(1) General.
-Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those subsections to-
(A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and
(B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to subsection (a) of this section.
(2) Temporary restraining orders.-
(A) In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person in danger.
(B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.
