How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


 have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

 Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter <br>
