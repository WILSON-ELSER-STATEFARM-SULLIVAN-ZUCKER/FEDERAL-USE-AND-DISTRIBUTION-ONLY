        (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall=

idence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than =
$50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the person=

7, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an approp=
riate United States district court for an order prohibiting that person f=
rom engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting th=
at person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the condu=
ct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition under this secti=
on does not preclude any other remedy which is available by law to the Un=
