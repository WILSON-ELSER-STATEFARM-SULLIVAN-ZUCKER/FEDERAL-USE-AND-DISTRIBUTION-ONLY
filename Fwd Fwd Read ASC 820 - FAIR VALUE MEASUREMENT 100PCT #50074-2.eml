million penalty, a censure, and an order to cease and desist from future 
violations..eml 15-1 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (ASC 
820, Fair Value Measurement).eml ---- DRP not required by the Directors 
of State Farm VP Management Corp.? - Attached are communications between 
3/31/2021 and as of current - for avoidance to an accuracy related 
penalty as attested by the Directors of the former CIK 93715 ( which has 
ceased to exist ) - in their current filer as the same CRD MEMBERS under 
the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK 1516523 have under CERT 63.18 failed 
to disclose any "legal proceeding", or "claims" after having 
participated in the letter of credit annexed in NYSCEF matter 
153974/2020 - and that there is "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT" Hence, 
it is important to keep those Directors in check, and more specifically 
the 9 executive links AFTER they don't update anything. - The TIPS I 
filed earlier as well, for convenience are held "somewhere" in the 
311-REPOSITORY, no address required there either as forward guidance. 
FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN STREET, where I 
filed a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT " as a document uploaded 
the prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY that I annexed in the matter 
and on the 4th of August in 2020 - I am certain the supervisor then and 
now have had an issue with the internet, as they were "unable to gain 
access to the building" to check on the "unlawful use of property" and 
"NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" complaint I filed with the Department of 
Buildings then, continues to report "unlawful" gross income to the NYC 
Finance Register for them to evaluate and automatically propagate a 
"MARKET VALUE" using the "base cap rate" - which is the "ordinary rate 
an investor would expect on real property" ---- as promulgated therein 
the receipts and by NYC Department of Finance in the Public Record, were 
more likely than not also issued to their investors and used to obtain a 
letter of credit as well, from State Farm in May of 2020, annexed in the 
matter as referenced hereunder. CAPACITY... Thank you for reviewing the 
attached emails and for convenience, I have included some other 
authorities on the matter in the CC for precision and good measure - to 
my understanding are the experts THENCE, FIRST on measurement. see also:

proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements (a)Persons liable; 
persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; suit at law or in 
equity; costs, etc. Any person who shall make or cause to be made any 
statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this 
chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking 
contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of 
section 78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the 
light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading 
with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not 
knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance 
upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price 
which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such 
reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith 
and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A 
person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in 
any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in 
its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of 
such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ 
fees, against either party litigant. (b)Contribution Every person who 
becomes liable to make payment under this section may recover 
contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined in 
the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment. 
(c)Period of limitations No action shall be maintained to enforce any 
liability created under this section unless brought within one year 
after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and 
within three years after such cause of action accrued. [SFITX] 15 U.S. 
Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations (5)The Commission shall consult with and 
consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a 
proposed rule filed by a registered securities association that 
primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government 
securities, except where the Commission determines that an emergency 
exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons 
therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the 
Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the 
Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before 
approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury 
determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, 
would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or 
efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the 
proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the 
Secretary’s determination. 
https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id739ce.pdf [t]he proper functioning 
of the securities industry and markets depends on the integrity of 
industry participants and their commitment to transparent disclosure. 
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . 
We have long held that a history of egregious fraudulent conduct 
demonstrates unfitness for future participation in the securities 
industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the 
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies 
on the fairness and integrity of all persons associated with each of the 
professions covered by the collateral bar to forgo opportunities to 
defraud and abuse other market participants. TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN 
AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS SEC. 17. (a) 
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal- (1) knowingly to sell any security or 
other property to such registered company or to any company controlled 
by such regis- tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) 
securities of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the 
seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the 
holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited with 
the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment plan by the 
depositor thereof; (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered 
company, or from any company controlled by such registered company, any 
security or other property (except securities of which the seller is the 
issuer) Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17. 
(h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither the 
charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office. In the event that any such instrument does not at the 
effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this 
subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the 
expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to 
be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate 
this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or 
officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any 
protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not 
comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected 
or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver. (i) 
After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or 
agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser 
of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall 
contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person 
against any liability to such company or its security holders to which 
he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by 
reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under 
such contract or agreement. Injunctions against gross abuse. SEC. 36. 
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of any Territory or 
other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging 
that a person serving or acting in one or more of the following 
capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within 
five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or 
gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company for 
which such person so serves or acts: (1) as officer, director, member of 
an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or (2) as principal 
underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit 
investment trust, or face-amount certificate company. If the 
Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of 
trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting in 
such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate. SEC. 32. (c) The 
Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in the 
public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof. DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND 
RECORDS SEC. 34. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as 
permitted by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to 
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c). (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue 
statement of a material fact in any registration statement, application, 
report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant 
to this title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 
(a). It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or 
keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in 
order to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

_Attached are supplements for convenience._
DRP not required by the Directors of State Farm VP Management Corp.?
- Attached are communications between 3/31/2021 and as of current - for 
avoidance to an accuracy related penalty as attested by the Directors of 
the former CIK 93715 ( which has ceased to exist ) - in their current 
filer as the same CRD MEMBERS under the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK 
1516523 have under CERT 63.18 failed to disclose any "legal proceeding", 
or "claims" after having participated in the letter of credit annexed in 
NYSCEF matter 153974/2020 - and that there is "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT"

Hence, it is important to keep those Directors in check, and more 
specifically the 9 executive links AFTER they don't update anything.

- The TIPS I filed earlier as well, for convenience are held "somewhere" 
in the 311-REPOSITORY, no address required there either as forward guidance.
FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN STREET, where I 
filed a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT " as a document uploaded 
the prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY that I annexed in the matter 
and on the 4th of August in 2020

- I am certain the supervisor then and now have had an issue with the 
internet, as they were "unable to gain access to the building" to check 
on the "unlawful use of property" and "NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" 
complaint I filed with the Department of Buildings then, continues to 
report "unlawful" gross income to the NYC Finance Register for them to 
evaluate and automatically propagate a "MARKET VALUE" using the "base 
cap rate" - which is the "ordinary rate an investor would expect on real 
property"
---- as promulgated therein the receipts and by NYC Department of 
Finance in the Public Record, were more likely than not also issued to 
their investors and used to obtain a letter of credit as well, from 
State Farm in May of 2020, annexed in the matter as referenced hereunder.


_CAPACITY.:_

Thank you for reviewing the attached emails and for convenience, I have 
included some other authorities on the matter in the CC for precision 
and good measure - to my understanding are the experts THENCE, FIRST on 
measurement.
