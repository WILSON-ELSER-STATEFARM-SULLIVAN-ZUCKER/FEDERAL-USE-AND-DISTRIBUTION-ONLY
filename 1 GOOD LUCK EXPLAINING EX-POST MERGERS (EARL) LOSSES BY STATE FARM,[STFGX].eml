commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held

§1963. Criminal penalties
<p>

(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the

The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition 
to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who 
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-

### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more

***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be

been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time

413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred

handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**

engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-

by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**

engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*
