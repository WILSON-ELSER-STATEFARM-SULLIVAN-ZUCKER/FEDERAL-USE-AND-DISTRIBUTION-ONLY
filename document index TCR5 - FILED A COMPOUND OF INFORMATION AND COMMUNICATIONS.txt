How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


 have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

 Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter <br>

of NYSCEF 153974_2020.<br>

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York “ONLY”….
—- without feeling “that vibe” of a different variety though, not “that vibe” when the bad guys are after you, the other vibe..  But still a vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets faxed with the header.

          “CEASE AND DESIST”

“Can’t find him… hah” they eventually are going to want to sue someone or file with the SEC and give up another client for immediate “heightened supervision” upon filing. 

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promised…

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear.

In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-
(1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in land; and
(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims, and securities.

### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written determination made by such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.

15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government securities, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a) 
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, acting as principal- 
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any company controlled by such registered company, any security or other property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17. 
(h) 	After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.

		In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) 	After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person against any liability to such company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36. 
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount

destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 (c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a). 

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being materially misleading.

26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on underpayments


https://a836-pts-access.nyc.gov/care/Datalets/PrintDatalet.aspx?pin=1005030011&gsp=PROFILEALL2&taxyear=2022&jur=65&ownseq=0&card=1&roll=RP_NY&State=1&item=1&items=-1&all=all&ranks=Datalet

26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on underpayments

§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and § 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see § 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see § 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement” or “gross valuation misstatement”), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see § 1.6662-5).


(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion of an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation misstatement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 6664(a) and
§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(“gross valuation misstatement”).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.

I ANNEXED THESE - JUST IN CASE.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME = $0.00
	
(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct related to transactions in government securities, except where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a) 
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter, acting as principal- 
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any company controlled by such registered company, any security or other property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17. 
(h) 	After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.

		In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i) 	After one year from the effective date of this title no contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to protect such person against any liability to such company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36. 
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32. 
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 (c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a). 

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO YEARS SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
	- TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS POINT)

SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL - THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
> THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

            (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.
