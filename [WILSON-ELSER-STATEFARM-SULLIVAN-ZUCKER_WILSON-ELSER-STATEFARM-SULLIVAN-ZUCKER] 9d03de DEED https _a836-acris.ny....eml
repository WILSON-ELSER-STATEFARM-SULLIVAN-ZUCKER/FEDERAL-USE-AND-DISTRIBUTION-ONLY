rpayments=0D
=0D
=C2=A7 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.=0D
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on an=
y portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and =C2=
=A7 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is attribu=
table to one or more of the following types of misconduct:=0D
=0D
(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see =C2=A7 1.6662-3)=
;=0D
=0D
(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see =C2=A7 1.6662-4); o=
r=0D
=0D
(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 (=E2=
=80=9Csubstantial valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cgross valua=
tion misstatement=E2=80=9D), provided the applicable dollar limitation se=
t forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see =C2=A7 1.6662-5).=0D
=0D
=0D
(b) Amount of penalty -=0D
=0D
(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent =
of the portion of an underpayment=0D
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of th=
e types of misconduct listed in paragraphs=0D
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b=
)(2) of this section.=0D
=0D
(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.=0D
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 6662=
(h)(2) and =C2=A7 1.6662-5(e)(2),=0D
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion o=
f an underpayment of tax required=0D
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation misst=
atement, provided the applicable=0D
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.=0D
=0D
=0D
=0D
=C2=A7 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapt=
er 1.=0D
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section =
6664(a) and=0D
=C2=A7 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A =
of the Code that is=0D
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial valuati=
on misstatement=0D
under chapter 1 (=E2=80=9Csubstantial valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D), t=
here is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.=0D=

=0D
Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a gros=
s valuation misstatement under chapter 1=0D
(=E2=80=9Cgross valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D).=0D
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of =
an underpayment=0D
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement unl=
ess the aggregate=0D
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross =
valuation misstatements=0D
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as provided=
 in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs=0D
(b) and=0D
(f)(2) of this section.=0D
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause =
and good faith exception to this penalty=0D
set forth in =C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to=
 this penalty.=0D
=0D
(b) Dollar limitation.=0D
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unl=
ess=0D
=0D
the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to sub=
stantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000=0D
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as def=
ined in section 1361(a)(1));=0D
=0D
or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).=0D
=0D
This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which ther=
e is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.=0D
=0D
=0D
=0D
(e) Definitions -=0D
=0D
(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.=0D
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted ba=
sis of any property claimed on a=0D
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct amount.=0D
=0D
(2) Gross valuation misstatement.=0D
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis of=
 any property claimed on a return of tax=0D
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.=0D
=0D
(3) Property.=0D
For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D refers =
to both tangible and intangible property.=0D
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures and=
 inventory.=0D
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to =
compete, leaseholds, patents,=0D
contract rights, debts and choses in action.=0D
=0D
=0D
(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -=0D
=0D
(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or g=
ross.=0D
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation mi=
sstatement on a return is=0D
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property =
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,=0D
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of =
100.=0D
=0D
Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a property-by-prop=
erty basis,=0D
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property B,=
 but not with respect to property A,=0D
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the corre=
ct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.=0D
=0D
(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the dollar=
 limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),=0D
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable =
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement=0D
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to s=
ubstantial or gross valuation misstatements.=0D
=0D
Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return is=
 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for propert=
y D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.=0D
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a substa=
ntial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated in apply=
ing the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if the port=
ion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the v=
alue of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the underpayment =
that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D, exce=
eds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).=0D
=0D
(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.=0D
=0D
The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a co=
rrect value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or =
more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with =
respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 4=
0 percent.=0D
