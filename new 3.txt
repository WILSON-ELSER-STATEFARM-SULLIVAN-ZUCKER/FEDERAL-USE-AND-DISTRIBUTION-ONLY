***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
    (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
    -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
        (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used by a person involved in the offense;
        (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation; and
        (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

    The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
    (b) Procedures.-
        (1) General.
        -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those subsections to-
            (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and

            (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.
            (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.
    (c) Affirmative Defense.
        -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under subsection (b) that the property-
        (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and
        (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is consistent with that purpose.
    (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
    (e) Assistance.
    (f) Owner Liability.

A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors of the issuer.

***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

            (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.
            (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.
    (c) Affirmative Defense.
        -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under subsection (b) that the property-
        (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and
        (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is consistent with that purpose.
    (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
