THE ZUCKER ENTERPRISES FILED SUIT AGAIN the CITY, ALSO OWE BACK TAXES ON 
THE 6 PROPERTIES THAT DESTROYED STATE FARM

- THE RESULT OF INSIDE INFORMATION, NO DISCLOSURE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, AND 
THE MOST DEPLORABLE CONDUCT I HAVE WITNESSED IN A COURT OF LAW

FOR YOU TO ALLOW FOR ANY FURTHRANCE OF THEIR OTHER ENTITIES, EMPLOYEES, 
REPRESENTATIVES, ETC. AND WITHOUT AN IMMEDIATE RESTRAINT OF THEIR 
BUSINESS DEALINGS IS LUDICROUS
- LET ALONE THEIR FREEDOMS TO FOLLOW ME TO BROOKLYN, TO SEE WHO I AM 
SPEAKING WITH, AND WHAT I AM UP-TO... NOT NORMAL. I DON'T FEEL MY LIFE 
IS IN DANGER, BUT DO YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE TO HAVE AN INSIDE SCOOP ON 
WHAT AGENCY I AM WORKING WITH?
- THEIR COUNSELORS, ASSOCIATED AND ATTORNEYS, YOU KNOW I HELP YOU FOR 
FREE WITHOUT ASKING FOR ANYTHING AND I NEVER LOOK BACK AT THOSE PRINTS 
EITHER.

- NEED TO HAVE A FORWARD LOOK AT WHAT I AM DOING - EVEN WITHOUT PAYING 
ME THE MONEY THEY STOLE WHICH IS STILL IN CUSTODY AT JP MORGAN CHASE, NA 
AS OF YESTERDAY AT 8PM EST.

     👔 another $600,000 request by the ZUCKER, filed in KINGS COUNTY: 
400842/2020 during 153974/2020---

Take a look at the STOCK PRICE OF TICKER " STFGX " on December 21, 2021 
and understand why the persons of interests need to maintain a certain 
DISTANCE from my whereabouts.

another $600,000 advance payment to pay the city back or build other 
projects???

     Probably to make a payment on the other $500 million they owe in 
back taxes on the 6 properties transferred and used as “collateral” or 
“creditworthiness” to obtain a loan from State Farm Life Insurance for 
$6,000,000.00

Do you need a few more cameras or microphones in my suite to better

Go ahead and read this one, it’s public information anyways. Old news in 
fact..

$6,000,000.00

While keeping me occupied in NYSCEF 153974/2020






That’s filed.

image2.jpeg




And so is this letter of obstruction



August 10, 2020

— willfully and knowingly continue and also filed for a 600000 benefit 
from NYC on 09/23/2020 as referenced above.

I saw nothing was handled, and filed this after providing them more than 
enough time, between the courts l, and all the law firms involved, and 
to no avail.

All you see is the price drop after I notified their promoters on 
December 18-19 ( in FY 2021). See also: ticker STFGX and their self 
declared payments in the “merger” of CIK filer 93715 into 1516523 where 
the Directors of State Farm Life Insurance also filed their USC Title 
18.215 confirmation of payments received with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

If I ask one more question, it will spark your interest to no end, so I 
will! Those security deposits, as per the letter that I annexed — were 
deposited at JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA in “interest bearing accounts”, 
does the Sullivan Properties LP account for any of that in their tax 
returns, for any tenants? And do those deposits for the 6 buildings (in 
the interest bearing accounts) match what is filed with NYC finance 
register?

But more more importantly, what does JP Morgan do with their overnight 
reserves? Who exactly decided to use them as a custodian in lieu of HSBC 
at the Sullivan Properties?

Their income is unlawful, and was loaned, bore interest, and only the 
lord knows what else. So I don’t any interest, as stated yesterday.

-- Just the principle, which is THEFT and unlawfully represented to 
State Farm to the contrary.

*** SOMEONE ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE EMAIL ADDRESS --- AND HAD IT 
DELETED.
JUST LIKE THE ONE THEY DELETED ON DECEMBER 19TH, 2021

--------    THEN THE OTHER EMAIL, "RANDOMLY" BD2561@COLUMBIA. became an 
issue around the time the tri-fecta of advisors instead of asking take 
the advice of this Zucker Enterprise, who I believe I saw one around my 
hotel.

While dealing with their business in Brooklyn, New York.

regarding the work conducted in the residence, which was completed as 
referenced in the latter images entered; the Mirror was hung in good taste.

x. ITEM 23
4 April 2020. Defendants attest and document the building 
superintendent’s coordination of Defendants’ purported residents and 
entered a photograph of cigarette butts and used this image on several 
occasions as referenced in the AFFIDAVITS of the earlier BRANDON as 
entered in the County of Alameda, in the State of California, which is 
also not in the ZIP-CODE 10018.

xi. ITEM 24
11 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to several emails 
circulated internally by Defendants which in this case the Defendant was 
in the State of California, Notarized the same and entered separately in 
the ANNEXED email in EX04 – entered an additional Docket Number 14 under 
the false light of Alexis Brandon under the auspice of the ZUCKERS 
distributed, tampered, adjusted, and have not returned any photographs 
or videos as requested in email, letter, and by telephone – 
notwithstanding myself positioned and “…banging on the radiator…” on the 
27TH of April, 2020 – which I affirm as ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of 
MIWAKO G. MESSER, as I recall this intimate encounter in the flesh – was 
a trespass of the sanctity of my home while in the nude as seen from the 
corridor and the gazing eyes ANNEXED and entered by Defendants in the 
matter.

xii. ITEM 25
11 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to the mother of a 
resident, ANNE BRANDON – after having entered the AFFIDAVIT of ALEXIS 
BRANDON entered on the 11th of APRIL and the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G. 
MESSER who under oath represents Miss Brandon having to leave on the 
12TH of April in light of the documented chronicle of information 
entered and sworn to by Defendants in the matter, notwithstanding Miss 
Ashley Humphries who notarized the Affidavit of John Doe as furthered 
hereunder on behalf of the ELSERS and the unlawful fees collected by the 
ZUCKERS, per the terms of their own lease.

xiii. ITEM 27
13 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the principles of the ZUCKER, namely Laurie Zucker, Anne 
Brandon, Paul Regan, Cory Weiss, and other members named above 
re-iterate that ALEXIS BRANDON is leaving the building, after 
demonstrating that she was already in California on the 11TH while ANNE 
BRANDON was purported to be writing emails to the named defendants in 
the matter who in fact harassed me at all times demonstrably as 
referenced in ITEM 4 as a tenant in one of their properties and 
throughout the term and lease agreement which terminated on the 31ST of 
December, 2020 whereby my STUDIO was understood to be their “Premises” 
under which I was photographed, documented in the AFFIDAVITS of their 
residents, and purported as legal residents of the building and address 
where I resided in the County of New York, addressed formerly at 111 
Sullivan Street, APT 2BR, New York, NY 10012.

xiv. ITEM 28
15 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the NEXUS of the ZUCKERS, whereby the window which provides 
egress to the fire-escape was damaged, boarded-up and was not repaired 
at any point in time. Despite the requests for EMERGENCY access, was 
deemed as appropriate in the ORAL ARGUMENT of SHARI S. LASKOWITZ, who on 
behalf of the YUZERS represented the interests of the ZUCKERS documented 
myself as locked out and capable of entering the premises as a basis of 
fitness. It was deemed of no consequence or urgency, as the Defendants 
in this matter were also neglectful of my physical health as furthered 
hereunder, despite the continuance as “chronicled” in the daily recount 
of my personal life. As referenced previously and during the time period 
referenced under ITEM 4 – obsessively would document each and every 
aspect of my life, certain of those claims are in fact a perjury under 
Federal and State Law, as sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized by the 
ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.

xv. ITEM 29
19 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented as “calm” and also wearing “earbuds” – a claim in their first 
docket as admitted.

xvi. ITEM 30
19 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented as owner of a “tape gun”, while videotaping, recording, and 
documenting my every step and motion referenced previously and during 
the time period referenced under ITEM 4 – obsessively and without my 
consent, destroyed the sanctity of my home in their coordinated 
observations entered by and on behalf of the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and ELSERS 
was admittedly documented as closing my door was entered in the FEDERAL 
record as such and “twice in an hour’s time.” – which demonstrates a 
scrutinized violation of my privacy by all the NEXUS of Defendants named 
in the caption of this matter, sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized 
by the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.

xvii. ITEM 32
21 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating

the location and departure of ALEXIS BRANDON, who notarized the letter 
on the same date emailed by her mother, purportedly as entered by 
Defendants in the matter – was more likely than not tampered with.

xix. ITEM 34
28 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, in furtherance of 
myself documented “…banging on the radiator…” through the door was 
admitted by the YUZERS on behalf of the ZUCKERS as being “…watched… 
opening his door… outside of the front door frame…”

xxix. ITEM 46
22 May 2020. Defendants again document to circulating emails by and 
between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, YUZERS and ELSERS and disdain to my 
culinary skills, as furthered hereunder was also introduced as a 
coordination of emails, as purported, by two building residents who 
allegedly resided in their Premises located at 111 Sullivan Street, New 
York, NY 10012.

xxx. ITEM 47
24 May 2020. Defendants again document to circulating emails by and 
between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, YUZERS and ELSERS and have an ongoing 
problem of flooding in the building, despite having a collection of 
written, photographed, videotaped, and recorded audio continue to place 
blame on myself for a 1/8” inch hole which was reported on the 28TH of 
March, and was repaired.

xxxi. ITEM 48
28 March 2020. Plaintiff previously attests to having reported the 1/8” 
hole, document such as this was circulated by and between the NEXUS of
