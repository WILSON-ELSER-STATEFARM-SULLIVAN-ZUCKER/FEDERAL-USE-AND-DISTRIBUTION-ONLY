  SEC Charges Broker-Dealer for Failures Related to Filing Suspicious
  Activity Reports

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2021-82

Washington D.C., May 12, 2021 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges 
against GWFS Equities Inc. (GWFS), a Colorado-based registered 
broker-dealer and affiliate of Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance 
Company, for violating the federal securities laws governing the filing 
of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). GWFS provides services to 
employer-sponsored retirement plans.

According to the SEC’s order, from September 2015 through October 2018, 
GWFS was aware of increasing attempts by external bad actors to gain 
access to the retirement accounts of individual plan participants. The 
order further finds that GWFS was aware that the bad actors attempted or 
gained access by, among other things, using improperly obtained personal 
identifying information of the plan participants, and that the bad 
actors frequently were in possession of electronic login information 
such as user names, email addresses, and passwords.

Broker-dealers are required to file SARs for certain transactions 
suspected to involve fraudulent activity or a lack of an apparent 
business purpose. The guidance for preparing SARs from the U.S. Treasury 
Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) states that 
in order to be effective tools for law enforcement and fulfill their 
intended purpose, SAR narratives should include “the five essential 
elements of information – who? what? when? where? and why? – of the 
suspicious activity being reported.” The order finds that GWFS failed to 
file approximately 130 SARs, including in cases when it had detected 
external bad actors gaining, or attempting to gain, access to the 
retirement accounts of participants in the employer-sponsored retirement 
plans it serviced. Further, for nearly 300 SARs that GWFS did file, the 
order finds that GWFS did not include the “five essential elements” of 
information it knew and was required to report about the suspicious 
activity and suspicious actors, including cyber-related data such as URL 
addresses and IP addresses.

“Across the financial services industry, we have seen a large increase 
in attempts by outside bad actors to gain unauthorized access to client 
accounts,” said Kurt L. Gottschall, Director of the SEC’s Denver 
Regional Office. “By failing to file SARs and by omitting information it 
knew about the suspicious activity it did report, GWFS deprived law 
enforcement of critical information relating to the threat that outside 
bad actors pose to retirees’ accounts, particularly when the 
unauthorized account access has been cyber-enabled.”

The SEC’s order notes that significant cooperation by GWFS with the 
SEC’s investigation and subsequent remedial efforts were taken into 
account in the determination to accept the company’s settlement offer. 
The remedial efforts included adding dedicated anti-money laundering 
(AML) staff and systems, replacing key personnel, clarifying delegation 
of responsibility for filing SARs, and implementing new SAR-related 
policies, procedures, standards, and training.

The SEC’s order finds that GWFS violated Section 17(a) of the Securities 
Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the 
SEC’s findings, GWFS agreed to a settlement that imposes a $1.5 million 
penalty, a censure, and an order to cease and desist from future violations.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by L. James Lyman with assistance 
from Daniel J. Goldberg, Damon Reed, David Cohen, and Andrae S. Eccles 
of the Enforcement Division’s Bank Secrecy Act Review Group. The case 
was supervised by Ian S. Karpel and Jason J. Burt. The SEC’s examination 
that led to the investigation was conducted by Denise S. Saxon, Phil 
Perrone, and Joni S. Marks with assistance from Lisa Byington.

*/Opinions on the Financial Statements/*

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, 
including the schedules of investments, of**State Farm Growth Fund, 
State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm 
Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment 
Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of 
September 30, 2021, *the related statements of operations for the period 
December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended 
November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related 
notes,****and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated 
therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our 
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of 
September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended 
November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the 
financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.*

*/Basis for Opinions/*

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ 
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting 
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect 
to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included 
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


November 22, 2021

We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in 
Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

*/Opinions on the Financial Statements/*

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, 
including the schedules of investments, of**State Farm Growth Fund, 
State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm 
Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment 
Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of 
September 30, 2021, *the related statements of operations for the period 
December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended 
November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related 
notes,****and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated 
therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our 
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of 
September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended 
November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the 
period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the 
financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.*

*/Basis for Opinions/*

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ 
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting 
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect 
to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included 
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by 
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not 
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


November 22, 2021

We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in 
Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

          Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled
          charges against GWFS Equities Inc. (GWFS), a Colorado-based
          registered broker-dealer and affiliate of Great-West Life
          &amp; Annuity Insurance Company, for violating the federal
          securities laws governing the filing of Suspicious Activity
          Reports (SARs). GWFS provides services to employer-sponsored
          retirement plans. </p>

          font-family: inherit; font-size: 13px; vertical-align:
          baseline; color: black; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">According
          to the SEC’s order, from September 2015 through October 2018,
          GWFS was aware of increasing attempts by external bad actors
          to gain access to the retirement accounts of individual plan
          participants. The order further finds that GWFS was aware that
          the bad actors attempted or gained access by, among other
          things, using improperly obtained personal identifying
          information of the plan participants, and that the bad actors
          frequently were in possession of electronic login information
          such as user names, email addresses, and passwords.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding:

          baseline; color: black; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">Broker-dealers
          are required to file SARs for certain transactions suspected
          to involve fraudulent activity or a lack of an apparent
          business purpose. The guidance for preparing SARs from the
          U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement
          Network (FinCEN) states that in order to be effective tools
          for law enforcement and fulfill their intended purpose, SAR
          narratives should include “the five essential elements of
          information – who? what? when? where? and why? – of the
          suspicious activity being reported.” The order finds that GWFS
          failed to file approximately 130 SARs, including in cases when
          it had detected external bad actors gaining, or attempting to
          gain, access to the retirement accounts of participants in the
          employer-sponsored retirement plans it serviced. Further, for
          nearly 300 SARs that GWFS did file, the order finds that GWFS
          did not include the “five essential elements” of information
          it knew and was required to report about the suspicious
          activity and suspicious actors, including cyber-related data
          such as URL addresses and IP addresses.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding:

          baseline; color: black; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">“Across
          the financial services industry, we have seen a large increase
          in attempts by outside bad actors to gain unauthorized access
          to client accounts,” said Kurt L. Gottschall, Director of the
          SEC’s Denver Regional Office. “By failing to file SARs and by
          omitting information it knew about the suspicious activity it
          did report, GWFS deprived law enforcement of critical
          information relating to the threat that outside bad actors
          pose to retirees’ accounts, particularly when the unauthorized
          account access has been cyber-enabled.”</p>

          SEC’s order notes that significant cooperation by GWFS with
          the SEC’s investigation and subsequent remedial efforts were
          taken into account in the determination to accept the
          company’s settlement offer. The remedial efforts included
          adding dedicated anti-money laundering (AML) staff and
          systems, replacing key personnel, clarifying delegation of
          responsibility for filing SARs, and implementing new
          SAR-related policies, procedures, standards, and training.</p>

          SEC’s order finds that GWFS violated Section 17(a) of the
          Securities Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without
          admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, GWFS agreed to a
          settlement that imposes a $1.5 million penalty, a censure, and
          an order to cease and desist from future violations.</p>

          SEC’s investigation was conducted by L. James Lyman with
          assistance from Daniel J. Goldberg, Damon Reed, David Cohen,
          and Andrae S. Eccles of the Enforcement Division’s Bank
          Secrecy Act Review Group. The case was supervised by Ian S.
          Karpel and Jason J. Burt. The SEC’s examination that led to
          the investigation was conducted by Denise S. Saxon, Phil
          Perrone, and Joni S. Marks with assistance from Lisa Byington.</p>

        Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and

        error or fraud.    </p>

        procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
        financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
        performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
        procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
        regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
        principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
        well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
        statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
        owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the
        custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from
        brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that
        our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</p>

                        party adverse to the Registrant or any of its
                        subsidiaries; and (3) any proceeding involving

                        Item B.14. Provision of financial support.<br>
                        Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a

                        17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), (3)
                        purchase of any defaulted or devalued security
                        at fair value reasonably intended to increase or

                        Registrant's portfolio, (4) execution of letter
                        of credit or letter of indemnity, (5) capital

                        guarantee, or (7) other similar action

                        value or liquidity of the Registrant's
                        portfolio. Provision of financial support does
                        not include any (1) routine waiver of fees or

                        (4) action that would qualify as financial
                        support as defined above, that the board of
                        directors has otherwise determined not to be
                        reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the
                        value or liquidity of the Registrant's
                        portfolio.     </span></font><br>
