YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO TREAT THEIR STUDENTS LIKE THAT?
- AS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION?

YOU CAN'T ALLOW THAT EITHER... IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE.
>> THOSE CAMERAS --- ARE ALL MONITORED AND EVEN IN MY APARTMENT
- AS PROVIDED EARLIER, NEED TO RECORD MY CONVERSATIONS FOR SOMETHING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW ASHLEY.

> WHICH IS WHY, I BEG YOU TO PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE, IN GOOD CANDOR - NOT LEGAL ADVICE, THAT'S LIFE.



THAT LINK - IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED EITHER---
