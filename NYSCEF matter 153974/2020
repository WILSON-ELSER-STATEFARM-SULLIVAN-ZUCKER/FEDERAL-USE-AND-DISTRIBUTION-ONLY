>>             Your inquiry was received by the FDIC on June 21, 2022. Your case number is:  01413744. The FDIC will respond to your inquiry within 14 calendar days.
>>
>>             The FDIC insures deposits held at member banks located in the United States. The FDIC protects depositors against the loss of their deposits if an FDIC-insured bank fails. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.
>>
>>             Your deposit insurance question will be answered by appropriate FDIC staff in accordance with the timelines referenced above. You may be contacted by an FDIC Subject Matter Expert for additional information if needed to respond fully to your inquiry.
>>
>>             While we prepare a response to your question, you may visit the FDIC’s deposit insurance homepage, where you can find the "Your Insured Deposits" brochure (a Comprehensive Guide) which explains in detail all of the deposit insurance ownership categories. 
>>
>>             You can also visit the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator or "EDIE", which allows you to calculate the insurance coverage of your accounts and clearly states if your deposits are fully insured. Also available are “Deposit Insurance Videos” that are helpful in answering your insurance questions. These and other deposit insurance resources, can be accessed directly by clicking the following link:  https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/
