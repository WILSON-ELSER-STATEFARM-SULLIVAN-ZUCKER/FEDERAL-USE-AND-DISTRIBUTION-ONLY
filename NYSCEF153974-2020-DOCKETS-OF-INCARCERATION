Hey it is Sunday, and as promised.
— that truth does hurt when the dust settles, I can hit three court houses in 30 States this quickly.  

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York “ONLY”….
—- without feeling “that vibe” of a different variety though, not “that vibe” when the bad guys are after you, the other vibe..  But still a vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets faxed with the header.

          “CEASE AND DESIST”

“Can’t find him… hah” they eventually are going to want to sue someone or file with the SEC and give up another client for immediate “heightened supervision” upon filing. 

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promised…

— that truth hurts, doesn’t it… had to get my beauty rest I’m sorry, but look Nancy sunshine???!!!

Christmas came early for some, but if they sold it in the quarter prior while the price was higher… then for sure they are not going to talking to any regulatory choir.

Like as in, the Jury— I met Johnny, a loooooooomg time ago, and just enough time , as implied.

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB


 have a certificate of occupancy.


 Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter

Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual proceedings and during the COVID-19 pandemic decided to Violate my Privacy and my home, perverted and self-proclaimed landlords most likely have more items which need be reviewed in their thought process ( as in evaluated ) to avoid "spillage" with the brains of general population, as I belive they are substandard, no matter how much money they have — combined. /s/ Bo Dincer.

FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.
